        In Java, loops are useful to allow the execution of a set of statements or methods repeatedly. In all cases, executions are continued when a testing condition evaluates to true and terminated when the Boolean value of the condition returns false. Therefore, it is vital to include the condition in the loop or else it would not work!

        Repeats the execution statements based on a testing condition which once again, should return a Boolean value of true. It can also be thought as a repeating ‘if’ statement!
        \n\nThe while loop is considered an event-controlled condition and should be used when the number of iterations is not known, relying the amount of repetitions on the satisfaction of the condition.
