    <string name="theoryblock1"> In Java, loops are a useful tool by allowing the execution of a statement or method repeatedly. In all cases, functions are repeated until a certain condition is evaluated to true. Therefore, it is vital to include a condition inside the initialization of the loop or else it would not work!
    \n \nThere are three main types of loop execution which provide a similar basic functionality but differ in their syntax and when they check the condition evaluation.

        •	INITIALIZATION CONDITION:
        \nThe variable is initialized here, beginning the for loop. A previously declared variable can be used or a new variable is declared, local to the loop.
        \n\n•	TESTING CONDITION:
        \nThe loop is executed until the testing condition returns a Boolean value of ‘false’ and is the exit condition for the loop. The condition is checked before the execution of loop statements.
        \n\n•	INCREMENT/DECREMENT:
        \nUpdates the declared variable for the next iteration.
        \n\n•	STATEMENT(S):
        \nOnce the testing condition returns a Boolean value of true, the statement in the loop body is executed.
        \n\n•	TERMINATION:
        \nThe loop is terminated when the condition evaluates to false.

    •	BOOLEAN CONDITION:
    \nAlso known as the testing condition, the condition is checked before execution of loop statements.
    \n\n•	STATEMENT(S):
    \nThe body of the loop is executed when the boolean condition returns true. The statements should contain an updated value for the variable, usually an increment/decrement for the next iteration.
    \n\n•	TERMINATION:
    \nThe loop is terminated when the condition evaluates to false.

    •	STATEMENT(S):
        \nThe loop begins with an execution of the statement. Once again, this should include an updated value for the variable (of an increment/decrement) for the next iteration.
    \n\n•	BOOLEAN CONDITION:
        \nAlso known as the testing condition, the condition is checked after execution of loop statements. It is checked after the statement execution, if it returns ‘true’, the next iteration starts.
    \n\n•	TERMINATION:
        \nThe loop is terminated when the condition evaluates to false.
